### Introduction

Designed for those who like modern UI elements and beautiful websites. Made of hundred of elements, designed blocks and fully coded pages, Horizon UI is ready to help you create stunning websites and webapps.

Save hundreds of hours trying to create and develop a dashboard from scratch.
The fastest, most responsive & trendiest dashboard for Tailwind CSS is here. Seriously.

With Horizon UI you will find many examples for pages like NFTs Pages,
Authentication Pages, Profile and so on. Just choose between a Basic Design or a cover and you are good to go!

### Documentation

Each element is well presented in a very complex documentation. You can read more about the <a href="https://horizon-ui.com/docs-tailwind/docs/react/installation?" target="_blank">documentation here.</a>

The installation is different, although we expect you can figure out how to do that yourself.

```

### Reporting Issues

For the most part, issues of this library are related to Horizon UI itself, not our fork.<br>
However, all issues should be pointed to our Github Issues instead, and we will redirect you if needed.

Please ensure these things before opening an issue:

1. Make sure that you are using the latest version of the Horizon UI Vite Dashboard.
2. Providing us reproducible steps for the issue will shorten the time it takes for it to be fixed.
3. Some issues may be specific to your setup, so let us know what computer & browser you use.
